#IHM plan

#1 Data & Cleaning
	-  Import : Upload csv
        -  Mapping : "Which column is Text ? Which is Label? Is supervied or not ? -- we could "attempt" dynamically else user input
        - Cleaning : should be able ot choose cleaning rules
        - Train/Test split (to be used by default, unless human wants seperate test dataset)
        - Shows snippets of before vs after in the dataset


#2 Annotation Studio (The "Human" Baseline) :
        - Takes the "test" set otherwise  a specifc unlabeled dataset
        - Display one tweet at atime (and a total of N tweets : N >= test set) with progress button
        - Show actions for label "Pos/Neut/Neg" or 0/2/4 depending on the dataset + allow to manually change labels
        - Output : Saves a mnaual_annotations.csv and save the classificaiton (only if user completes it)
        - add a button to fill in randomly (for test purposes)

#3 Keywords :
        - Configure params, Train (fit), Type a tweet and get a predicition

#4 KNN :
        - Configure params, Train (fit), Type a tweet and get a predicition

#5 Clustering :
        - Configure params, Train (fit),  (Do equivalent of :Type a tweet and get a predicition but for unsuperivsed learning)

#6 Bayes  :
        - Configure params, Train (fit), Type a tweet and get a predicition

#5 Comparison Analysis:
        - Illustrate performance anaylisis between diffrent algorihmts inclduing human
